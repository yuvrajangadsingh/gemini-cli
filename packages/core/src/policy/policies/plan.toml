# Priority system for policy rules:
# - Higher priority numbers win over lower priority numbers
# - When multiple rules match, the highest priority rule is applied
# - Rules are evaluated in order of priority (highest first)
#
# Priority bands (tiers):
# - Default policies (TOML): 1 + priority/1000 (e.g., priority 100 → 1.100)
# - User policies (TOML): 2 + priority/1000 (e.g., priority 100 → 2.100)
# - Admin policies (TOML): 3 + priority/1000 (e.g., priority 100 → 3.100)
#
# This ensures Admin > User > Default hierarchy is always preserved,
# while allowing user-specified priorities to work within each tier.
#
# Settings-based and dynamic rules (all in user tier 2.x):
#   2.95: Tools that the user has selected as "Always Allow" in the interactive UI
#   2.9:  MCP servers excluded list (security: persistent server blocks)
#   2.4:  Command line flag --exclude-tools (explicit temporary blocks)
#   2.3:  Command line flag --allowed-tools (explicit temporary allows)
#   2.2:  MCP servers with trust=true (persistent trusted servers)
#   2.1:  MCP servers allowed list (persistent general server allows)
#
# TOML policy priorities (before transformation):
#   10: Write tools default to ASK_USER (becomes 1.010 in default tier)
#   20: Plan mode catch-all DENY override (becomes 1.020 in default tier)
#   50: Read-only tools (becomes 1.050 in default tier)
#   999: YOLO mode allow-all (becomes 1.999 in default tier)

# Catch-All: Deny everything by default in Plan mode.
